# Notes

A system to collect and organize notes and tips for python projects.

## Links

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do
- [[tips]] - a place to keep tips
- [[notes]] - a place to keep notes

## Note on `[[wiki-links]]`

⚠️ Until [foambubble/foam#16](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/16) is resolved, `[[wiki-links]]` links (like the links above) won't work in the GitHub Markdown preview (i.e. this Readme on github.com).

They should work as expected in VS Code, and in rendered GitHub Pages.

If GitHub preview (or general 100% support with all Markdown tools) is a requirement, for the time being you can use the standard `[description](page.md)` syntax.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
[tips]: tips "Tips"
[notes]: notes "Notes"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
